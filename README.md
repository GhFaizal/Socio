# Socio
SOCIO is a social media frontend inspired by the old Twitter interface with a modern, code-editor-like theme. It features a sleek black-and-white design, vibrant buttons, and dynamic post layouts. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases my skills in frontend web development.
